# Artificial Intelligence applied to robotics

A python project build on ROS platform for Artificial Intelligence applied to robotics course (Engineering).

# Description

This practice was based on analyzing a problem (labyrinth) in which the solution path was found by applying the artificial intelligence algorithm A*. Once the solution path was achieved, the solution was translated into a several movements that made the Kobuki robot move in a real maze through Python programming code on the ROS platform.
